                <h2><i>Oil Painting</i></h2>
                <p>Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder.Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil,walnut oil,and safflower oil.
                    The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil plant, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time.Certain differences,depending on the oil,are also visible in the sheen of paints.
                    An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired.</p>
